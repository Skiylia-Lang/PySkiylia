//Notation for Skiylia

//vertical bar implies choices
// rule > option 1 | option 2 | option 3
//ie: option 1; or option 2

//Parentheses implies a grouping, speech marks means that must appear exactly
// rule > (option 1 | option 2) "done"
//ie: option 1 done

//Asterisk implies what it is attatched to repeats zero or more times
// rule > "test" "example"*
//ie: test example example example; or even test

//Plus implies what it is attatched to repeats one or more times
// rule > "test"+
//ie: test; or test test test test test

//Question mark implies something appears exactly zero or one times
// rule > (option 1 | option 2)? "done"
//ie: option1 "done"; or "done"; option1 option2 "done" not allowed
